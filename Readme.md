# My DevOps Project
A modern DevOps project demonstrating Git best practices, automated CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployment workflows.

## ✨ Features
🔄 Modern Git Workflow - Feature branches, pull requests, automated merging

🚀 Automated CI/CD - GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

🐳 Docker Containerization - Consistent development and production environments

🧪 Automated Testing - Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting

📊 Health Monitoring - Built-in health checks and status endpoints

📚 Professional Documentation - Complete setup and usage instructions

🏷️ Release Management - Semantic versioning with automated releases

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)

Docker (v20.10 or higher)

Git (v2.30 or higher)
## 🚀 Quick Start
Local Development
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shreya123688/my-devops-project.git
cd my-devops-project

# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

# The server will start on http://localhost:3000
```
Using Docker
```
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or run with plain Docker
docker build -t my-devops-project .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-devops-project
```
Quick Test
```
# Test the application
curl http://localhost:3000          # Main endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health   # Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/version  # Version info
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow
We follow the GitHub Flow for collaborative development:

1. Create Feature Branch
```
# Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
2. Development Process
```
# Make your changes
# Edit files, add features, fix bugs

# Test your changes
npm test
npm start  # Test manually

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
```
## 3. Push and Create Pull Request
```
# Push your branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request (using GitHub CLI)
gh pr create --title "Add your feature" --body "Description of your changes"
```
## 4. Code Review and Merge
Wait for code review and CI/CD checks

Address any feedback

Merge through GitHub interface after approval
## 🧪 Testing
```
# Run all tests
npm test

# Start application for manual testing
npm start

# Test with Docker
docker-compose up
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
## 🚀 Deployment
Automatic Deployment
The project uses GitHub Actions for automatic deployment:

Push to main → Triggers production deployment

Pull Requests → Runs tests and validation

Tags → Creates releases automatically

Manual Deployment
```
# Build Docker image
docker build -t my-devops-project:latest .

# Run in production mode
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name devops-app my-devops-project:latest
```
## 📊 Monitoring
Health Checks
The application provides built-in monitoring endpoints:

Health Status: GET /health

Application Info: GET /

Version Info: GET /version

## CI/CD Status
Monitor your pipelines:

View GitHub Actions: Project Actions

Check build status in the badge above

Review deployment logs in the Actions tab

## 🏷️ Releases
We use semantic versioning for releases:

MAJOR: Breaking changes (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

MINOR: New features (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

PATCH: Bug fixes (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)

Creating Releases
```
# Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release version 1.1.0"
git push origin v1.1.0

# Create GitHub release
gh release create v1.1.0 --title "Version 1.1.0" --generate-notes
```
